# Collegeboard MCQ Test Corrections

Q4: Simulation should have been of a coin flip since other option was too complicated for the function.

Q26: The order of the function should have been reversed, since otherwise it would continue repeating itself.

Q30: I misread the code and thought the analysis function ran only 2 times instead of 5.

Q34: The function returns an adjusted number in the population for one animal but not that other (changed).

Q37: Since the each function was for a section with 2 lines of code instead of 1, there are more operations on the one with 2 lines.

Q39: I did not know what open protocols were - connections between hardware and software

Q42: I did not know how bits worked or what the % meant - base 2 powers, % represents the difference of the powers.

Q43: I did not know the timings for running algorithms - it should have run well in a reasonable time

Q44: Since the sum is not greater that 16 for option 3, it does not cause an overflow error.

Q45: 'And' should only be used if both variables are false but should evaluate to true.

Q46: It is not possible to create an algorithm that can solve an undecidable problem.

Q47: If the recipient's public key is needed to encrypt something. their private key is needed to decrypt it.

Q51: Symmetric encryption involves the same 'key' to both encrypt and decrypt something.

Q53: Machine learning programs are used to handle data; analyzing, finding patterns, and creating predictions.

Q55: There cannot be 2 responses for the same input, therefore there cannot be an answer that yields the 'true' output.

Q56: I did not notice that count added 2 instead of 1. so the code displays the sum of odd integers from 1 to 19.

Q58: I did not know about how the internet enables crowdsourcing - it gives participants access to information and allows people from different locations to contribute.

Q60: Abstraction can replace many lines of data into simpler documentations through a list of strings.

Q62: Online encyclopedias allow a larger amount of input from users than it could if it was paper.
