## Creating Notebook

---
As I was creating the CompSci page, I ran in to some problems. I created it by adding the file with the same format and details as the one in the example. I added an .md file to add it to the table given in the CompSci page, then copied the snake game into the file as directed. Originally I forgot to delete one line of code that was causing an error. After the error was resolved, I successfully added the game to the page with the link in the plans table.

I ran into a couple more issues when I was unable to make more files to fill up the table for different pages. Nothing would appear in the table even though I had seemingly done everything correctly. Eventually, I realized the file name was entered in the incorrect format, since I had forgotten to include the date as a prefix to the file.

After troubleshooting the difficulties, I learned properly how to add these pages to the table in the CompSci page, and was able to add the JS Calculator the same way I was able to add the game to my blog.
