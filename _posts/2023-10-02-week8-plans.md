The team roles were later adjusted - Bella took on the DevOps role (kept Backend Developer) and I (Lakshanya) stayed Scrum Master and added the role of 2nd Frontend Developer. Eun stayed as a Frontend Developer and Avanthika continued as a Backend Developer.

The Frontend Page did not stay the one displayed currently (shown in a later page) and the Backend Design was adjusted to work better with time constraints and limited knowledge (it was too difficult).
