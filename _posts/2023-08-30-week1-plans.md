## Home Page Creation

---

As I was creating my homepage, I explored the markdown cheat sheets that were given online. I looked through tables of syntax formatting and applied many of them into my code. I encountered problems with inserting images using markdown, since I was unable to adjust the size. To get around this problem, I used html image insertion, since I was able to figure out the formatting for this form.

A similar thing happened with text color and sizing, since I was unable to figure out how to change both for the same piece of text. I had to do some research in order to find the combined command for the adjestment.

After editing all my files, I learned how to commit them and show the progress on the displayed homepage.
