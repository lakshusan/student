### This is the feedback provided by ChatGPT for my table code with HTML.

The provided code appears to be an HTML snippet that is intended to be used within a Jupyter Notebook cell, as indicated by the %%html magic command at the beginning. Here's a review of the code:

HTML Structure: The code starts with an <*h2> (header) element that provides a title for the content, indicating that it's an HTML cell output in a Jupyter Notebook. This is a good practice for clarity.

HTML Table: The main content of the code is a table element (<*table>) with a class attribute set to "table." Inside the table, there is a table header (<*thead>) containing column headers, and a table body (<*tbody>) containing the data rows.

Table Header: The table headers (<*th>) are well-defined with three columns: "Book Series," "Release Year," and "Total Pages." This provides clarity and context to the data.

Table Rows: Each data row (<*tr>) represents a book series, with three data cells (<*td>) for the series name, release year, and total pages. The data is well-structured and organized.

Data Formatting: The numbers in the "Release Year" and "Total Pages" columns are appropriately formatted with commas for better readability.

Overall Clarity: The code is well-structured and easy to understand, which is important for readability and maintainability. It follows HTML best practices.

Usage in Jupyter Notebook: This HTML code would render as an HTML table in the output of a Jupyter Notebook cell, making it a convenient way to display structured data in a notebook.

Potential Improvement: While the code is well-constructed, it's important to ensure that it is embedded in a Markdown cell within the Jupyter Notebook. The %%html magic command should be used within a Markdown cell to render the HTML output correctly.

Overall, this HTML code snippet appears to be in good shape for displaying tabular data in a Jupyter Notebook, as long as it's placed within a Markdown cell as intended.
