## Downloading VScode and Tools

For most of this process, it was pretty smooth sailing, until I needed to run the make command. I had some difficulties making this work, and had to run some other commands and delete code that prevented me from doing these tasks before it was possible. Once all of this was done, I did everything on the instructions chronologically until I had a solid baseline for any future coding I worked on.
