## Agile Team Test

---

Bella and Eun created a python quiz code similar to what we made for out Pair Showcase. They altered the outputs of certain responses and added a code that calculates the score of the quiz with altered questions.

Avanthika and I created two new codes using an 'about us' dictionary code; We used an altered version of the example with Mr. Mortensen and Mr. Lopez's information. We also created an average calculator code, which calculates the average of a data set.
